# Nature-Conservancy-Fisheries-Monitoring
I use the kaggle competition 'Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring' as Capstone Project of Udacity ML Nanodegree

Only train data in the [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) is used here, since it is the only dataset with labels.

1. Data imbalance
There are 3777 images in total in the train dataset. Almost half of the images belong to one class 'ALB', there is a serious data imbalance problem as shown in this figure ![Train_data_sample_size](https://github.com/jundongq/Nature-Conservancy-Fisheries-Monitoring/blob/master/Train_data_sample_size.png)
